Here's the **Markdown version** of the `gnuhealth_pathology` table, structured and annotated for clarity and optimized for embedding in a vector database or knowledge base used with a language model like Gemma 4B:

---

# Table: `gnuhealth_pathology`

This table stores **disease and disorder records** in the GNU Health system, including classification, molecular data, and metadata for pathology entries.

---

## Primary Key

* `id` (`INTEGER`): Auto-incrementing unique identifier for the pathology record.

---

## Audit Fields

* `create_date` (`TIMESTAMP(6)`): Date and time when the record was created.
* `write_date` (`TIMESTAMP(6)`): Date and time when the record was last updated.
* `create_uid` (`INTEGER`): ID of the user who created the record.
* `write_uid` (`INTEGER`): ID of the user who last updated the record.

---

## Pathology Information Fields

* `category` (`INTEGER`): Foreign key to `gnuhealth_pathology_category(id)`, identifying the pathology’s classification category.
* `code` (`VARCHAR`): Internal or external classification code for the pathology.
* `name` (`VARCHAR`): Common or standardized name of the pathology.
* `info` (`TEXT`): Supplementary information or description about the pathology.
* `protein` (`VARCHAR`): Specific protein involved in the pathology.
* `gene` (`VARCHAR`): Specific gene associated with the pathology.
* `chromosome` (`VARCHAR`): Chromosome affected by the pathology.
* `active` (`BOOLEAN`, default `FALSE`): True if the pathology record is currently active.
* `uri` (`VARCHAR`): URI linking to external data sources or further information (e.g. medical databases, publications).

---

## Foreign Key Constraints

```sql
CONSTRAINT fk_pathology_category FOREIGN KEY (category)
  REFERENCES gnuhealth_pathology_category(id)
  ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE NO ACTION
```

* Ensures that each pathology is associated with a valid category.
* Allows for soft deletion of categories by setting related `category` values to NULL.

---

## Use Case Summary

* Enables classification and tracking of diseases by name, gene, protein, and chromosome.
* Supports external linking via `uri` for research or medical references.
* Designed for integration with broader medical classification systems.
* Useful for clinicians, researchers, and bioinformatic systems tracking genetic or molecular causes of disease.
